## About

L850-GL and L860-GL both a Fibocom 4G WWAN modules on a PCI-E m.2 interface. they are quite bit (30mm x 42mm x 2.3mm) and requires external antenas. coming at low price they seems to be great begger-friendly option for an aggregation setup. but they requires some workaround to work properly on any OS.

L850-GL is a Cat.9 4G WWAN. L860-GL is a Cat.16 4G WWAN. they are sharing drivers (more in a workaround chapter), and it seems like besides aggregation type there are no differences between them.

## 1st method

"official" method:

```Sh
# ssh to your router:
$ ssh root@192.168.1.1 -p 22

# insisde your router's shell:
opkg update                          # updates packages
opkg install modemmanager            # modemmanager and required software
opkg install luci-proto-modemmanager # LuCI module for modemmanager
reboot -f                            # reboot router
```

after that you'll need to execute `AT+GTUSBMODE=7` in **MODEM**'s shell and use `modemmanager` to create connection. 

but i (hand7s) haven't tried this method since

## 2nd method aka Workround

not-so-"official" method

i've seen this method on https://openwrt.132lan.ru's forum and just executed it. with this method we can **execute AT?** commands in modem's shell (with `atinout`), use GUI (LuCI) for connection managment (with `luci-proto-xmm`). and yes, i use this one.

```Sh
# ssh to your router:
$ ssh root@192.168.1.1 -p 22

# inside you router's shell:
wget -O /tmp/add.sh http://openwrt.132lan.ru/packages/24.10/packages/add.sh 
sh /tmp/add.sh
# we've just added openwrt.132lan.ru's repositories via this script
# now we need to install packages for modem
opkg update
opkg install luci-app-modeminfo modeminfo \
modeminfo-serial-xmm modeminfo-serial-fibocom \
luci-proto-xmm xmm-modem atinout luci-app-atinout
# and then
reboot -f
```

after that in Interfaces you'll be able to choose `Intel XMM Cellular`. 
also with `luci-app-atinout` and `luci-app-modeminfo` you'll be able to check modem's info, use `AT?` commands right inside LuCI.
